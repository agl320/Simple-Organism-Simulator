# Simple Survival Simulation

A simple cell survival simulation made by me back when I was younger using PyGame.

Features:
- Simulation of cells that exhibited a predator-prey dynamic; cells are programmed to only consume a specific type of cell
- Reproduction occurs after consumption of food
- Death occurs after n rounds have passed in which food has not been consumed
