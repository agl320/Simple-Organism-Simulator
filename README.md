# Simple Survival Simulation

A simple organism/cell survival simulation made by me back when I was younger using PyGame. A cleaner organism/cell implementation [here](https://github.com/xegativ/pygame-organism-simv2/tree/master), however other mechanics were never completed.

Features:
- Simulation of organisms that exhibited a predator-prey dynamic; organisms are programmed to only consume a specific type of organism (food)
- Reproduction occurs after consumption of food
- Death occurs after n rounds have passed in which food has not been consumed
