# Simple Survival Simulation

A simple organism survival simulation made by me back when I was younger using PyGame.

Features:
- Simulation of organisms that exhibited a predator-prey dynamic; organisms are programmed to only consume a specific type of organism (food)
- Reproduction occurs after consumption of food
- Death occurs after n rounds have passed in which food has not been consumed
